A python program I "repaired" as part of an assessment while studying at TAFE NSW.

All fixes towards the code have been noted in the comments.

Simple score calculator which calculates the total and average based on the scores provided. The scores must be between 0 and 100.

I fixed issues ranging from simple mistakes such as mismatched variable names and adding int( onto certain commands to creating new sections of code entirely which involved loops.
